# Scrappy-Scraper / Scrapoogle
Site that scrapes news stories and gives you the ability to blog about it. 

## More about stuff:

Specifically, this app is designed to pull articles from news.google.com with the headline, a brief summary and a link to the actual article.  When update is hit, it will give a list of all the articles that news.google.com provies at the time.  Anything highlighted with a background in green is an article that had previously been saved.  In the saved articles, you have the ability to store any new notes that your heart desires.  At the moment, there is no login so all notes are anonymous.  Soon I will add a login ability as well as more functionality once this class is done.  


## Installation
